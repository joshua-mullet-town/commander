## Objective
Capture the enemy flag and bring it back to your territory to win.

## Board
- 11x11 grid (x: 0-10, y: 0-10)
- Blue territory: rows 6-10 (Player A)
- Neutral zone: row 5
- Red territory: rows 0-4 (Player B)

## Teams
- Blue (Player A): You control pieces that start in rows 6-10
- Red (Player B): Enemy pieces that start in rows 0-4
- Each team has 5 pieces (IDs 0-4)

## Flags
- Blue flag spawns at (5, 10)
- Red flag spawns at (5, 0)
- Land on enemy flag to pick it up
- Bring enemy flag to your territory to WIN
- If flag carrier is tagged, flag returns to spawn

## Tagging & Jail
- In enemy territory: You can be tagged and sent to jail
- In your territory: You can tag enemies and send them to jail
- Jailed pieces appear in opponent's back row
- Rescue keys spawn randomly in your territory
- Pick up rescue key to free all your jailed pieces

## Movement
- Each round, give commands for your pieces
- Format: {pieceId, direction, distance}
- Directions: 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right'
- Distance: Any number of cells (up to board edge or until blocked)
- Pieces move simultaneously, then check collisions/tags
- Movement stops when hitting a wall, another piece, or the target distance

## Strategy Tips
- Protect your flag
- Coordinate attacks
- Use rescue keys to free teammates
- Balance offense and defense`;

## CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT REASONING PROCESS

Before making any moves, you MUST work through this reasoning process step-by-step:

### STEP 1: THREAT ASSESSMENT
Analyze the current board state:
- Does the enemy have MY flag? (check if ${myFlagKey}Flag.carriedBy exists)
  - If YES: Where are they? Calculate their distance to their territory (${enemyTerritory})
  - How many turns until they score? (this is CRITICAL - you LOSE if they reach their territory)
- Do I have the ENEMY flag? (check if ${enemyFlagKey}Flag.carriedBy exists and it's me)
  - If YES: What's my shortest path to MY territory (${myTerritory})?
  - Which enemies can intercept me? Calculate their distances.

**CRITICAL: NO-GUARD ZONE RULE**
- Check the board state for "restrictedSquares.yours" - these squares are OFF-LIMITS to your pieces
- These are the squares immediately around your flag (when your flag is still at its spawn point)
- You CANNOT move into these squares - any command that would land on a restricted square will FAIL
- Once your flag is carried away, the no-guard zone disappears and those squares become accessible
- ENEMY restricted squares ("restrictedSquares.enemy") are squares THEY cannot enter (you can enter them)

### STEP 2: PIECE ACCOUNTING
Count your resources:
- How many of my pieces are active and alive? (not jailed)
- How many of my pieces are jailed?
- How many enemy pieces are active?
- How many enemy pieces are jailed?
- Do I have numerical advantage or disadvantage?

### STEP 3: STRATEGIC PRIORITY DECISION
Based on steps 1-2, determine your PRIMARY goal for THIS turn:

**PRIORITY 1: EMERGENCY DEFENSE**
- If enemy has my flag AND is close to scoring (within 3-4 moves of their territory):
  → PRIMARY GOAL: Intercept flag carrier with multiple pieces
  → Calculate intercept points along their path
  → Commit 2-3 pieces to intercept, not just 1

**PRIORITY 2: SECURE THE WIN**
- If I have enemy flag AND path to my territory is clear:
  → PRIMARY GOAL: Move flag carrier to safety as FAST as possible
  → Use OTHER pieces as blockers/decoys
  → Take shortest path with large distance moves (5-10 cells per turn)

**PRIORITY 3: CAPTURE ENEMY FLAG**
- If enemy flag is unguarded OR weakly defended:
  → PRIMARY GOAL: Coordinate flag grab with 2+ pieces
  → Send decoys to split their defense
  → Use fast, aggressive moves through enemy territory

**PRIORITY 4: RESCUE OPERATIONS**
- If I have pieces jailed AND rescue key is available in my territory:
  → Calculate: Is it worth a piece to grab rescue key?
  → Only if it frees multiple pieces or enemy is winning

**PRIORITY 5: POSITIONAL PLAY**
- If no immediate threats/opportunities:
  → Keep 1-2 pieces near my flag as defenders
  → Push 2-3 pieces toward enemy flag
  → Spread out pieces - don't cluster

### STEP 4: TACTICAL CALCULATIONS
For your chosen priority, calculate specific moves:

**If defending:**
- Enemy flag carrier position: (x, y)
- Their path to territory: calculate likely direction
- My pieces that can intercept: list piece IDs and distances
- Best intercept point: where can I meet them fastest?

**If attacking:**
- My flag carrier position: (x, y)
- Distance to safety: calculate exact cells
- Obstacles in path: any enemy pieces blocking?
- Best escape route: straight line or evasive?

**If capturing flag:**
- Enemy flag position: (x, y)
- Enemy defenders nearby: how many within 3 cells?
- My raiders: which pieces are closest?
- Attack angle: which direction is least defended?

### STEP 5: MOVEMENT OPTIMIZATION
For each piece you're moving:
- Calculate exact distance needed (don't use tiny moves like 1-2 cells unless necessary)
- Use LONG moves (5-10 cells) to cross the board quickly
- Remember: you can move until you hit a wall or piece
- Consider where this piece will be NEXT turn after this move

### STEP 6: FINAL DECISION
State your FINAL STRATEGY for this turn in 2-3 sentences, then provide commands.

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

You MUST structure your response exactly like this:

CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT:
[Your step-by-step reasoning through all 6 steps above - be specific with positions and calculations]

STRATEGY:
[Your final strategic decision for THIS turn - 2-3 sentences]

COMMANDS:
[
  {"pieceId": 0, "direction": "down", "distance": 6},
  {"pieceId": 1, "direction": "right", "distance": 4}
]

Each command must have:
- pieceId: The ID of your piece (0-4)
- direction: One of "up", "down", "left", "right"
- distance: Any positive number (use large distances! 5-10 cells is normal)

Remember:
- Work through ALL steps before deciding
- Calculate exact positions and distances
- Make BOLD, aggressive moves when you have advantage
- INTERCEPT flag carriers immediately - don't let them score!
- Use long-distance moves to control the board

Play to WIN.`;
