TAP version 13
# ✅ Initial state test defined
# 🧪 INITIAL STATE TEST: Symmetrical board
#    Blue pieces: [ '(4,8)', '(5,8)', '(6,8)' ]
#    Red pieces: [ '(4,2)', '(5,2)', '(6,2)' ]
# 🎯 [POSITION EXPLORATION] Generating move for Player A
#    Step 1: Finding enemy's best moves...
#       Enemy piece 1: delta=0.00, move=up 0
#       Enemy piece 2: delta=0.00, move=up 0
#       Enemy piece 3: delta=0.00, move=up 0
#    Step 2: Finding AI's best moves (against enemy response)...
#       AI piece 1: delta=0.00, move=up 0
#       AI piece 2: delta=0.00, move=up 0
#       AI piece 3: delta=0.00, move=up 0
#    ✅ Best moves found
#    ⏱️  Execution time: 8ms
# 📊 AI Decision:
#    Commands returned: [
#   { pieceId: 1, direction: 'up', distance: 0 },
#   { pieceId: 2, direction: 'up', distance: 0 },
#   { pieceId: 3, direction: 'up', distance: 0 }
# ]
#    Piece 1: up 0
#    Piece 2: up 0
#    Piece 3: up 0
# ✅ PASS: AI correctly chose to stay still in initial state
#    All pieces have distance=0 (no movement)
# Subtest: PositionExplorationStrategy - Initial state: AI should choose to stay still
ok 1 - PositionExplorationStrategy - Initial state: AI should choose to stay still
